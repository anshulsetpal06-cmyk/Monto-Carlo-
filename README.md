# Quantitative Finance & Actuarial Models 📈

This repository contains a collection of quantitative financial models developed during my **M.Sc. in Quantitative Finance at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel**. These projects focus on stochastic modeling, risk assessment, and actuarial statistics.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1. Monte Carlo Simulation: Financial Risk Analysis
* **File:** `MontoCarlo.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To simulate potential future paths for financial assets and calculate Risk Metrics.
* **Key Features:**
    * Simulated over 10,000 scenarios using stochastic processes.
    * Estimated **99% Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and Expected Shortfall.
    * Visualized potential outcomes and extreme case behavior using Matplotlib.

### 2. Credit Risk / Default Probability Model
* **File:** `CreditRisk.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To estimate the Probability of Default (PD) for a credit portfolio.
* **Key Features:**
    * Built a logistic regression framework to analyze borrower characteristics.
    * Evaluated model performance using **ROC curves and AUC metrics**.
    * Interpreted coefficients to identify high-impact risk factors.
